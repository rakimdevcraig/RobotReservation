This is a full-stack application built with React that will allow users to see if a robot is available and if the robot is available gives users the ability to reserve it. It also gives users the ability to report any problems that are discovered with robots.

How It's Made: Tech used: React, Node-JS, MongoDB, Express 

The objective of this project was to create an app that made the reservation of robots much easier. At my company the process to reserve robots was a bit strenuous and users wanted something that was more simple and straightforward so that was the goal with this.

Optimization I would like to add login so users can know exactly who is reserving a robot. I also want to add websockets so that robots are reserved in realtime.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to incorporate data from a database into a react app. I also learned that sometimes having too complex of an app is something that users might not necessarily like and sometimes simpler is better. I've also learned about websockets and why they would be useful in an app like this.

Installation: Clone repo, run npm run server from the main folder, open up the client folder and run npm start from that folder, navigate to https://localhost:3000
